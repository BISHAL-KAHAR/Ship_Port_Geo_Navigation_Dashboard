# Ship_Port_Geo_Navigation_Dashboard
ShipPortGeoNavigationDashboard is a React app visualizing ship and port data with Mapbox GL. It processes geolocation data to show real-time positions on an interactive map. Users can track ships, view recent port visits, and analyze visit frequencies. The responsive design uses GeoJSON for geographic data.
